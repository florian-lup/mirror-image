            <p>
              I do my best to keep this website running smoothly, but like all technology, sometimes things break.
              I can't guarantee 100% uptime, and the AI responses are provided as-is. Please use common sense and
              don't rely on AI responses for critical decisions without verification.

            <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">Your Content</h3>
            <p>
              Anything you share with the AI (messages, questions) remains yours. No one is claiming ownership of your thoughts!
              Your conversations with the AI are used only to provide responses and aren't stored permanently.
