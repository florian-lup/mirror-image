              Hi! I want to be completely transparent about how your information is handled on my website.
              Privacy matters, and I respect yours.

              When you chat with the AI, your messages are used temporarily for the sole purpose of generating a response.
              Once the AI responds, that's it - nothing is saved or stored anywhere.

            <h3 className="text-base font-semibold text-foreground mb-3">How Your Data Is Handled</h3>
            <p>
              Your conversations with the AI work like this:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-1 ml-4">
              <li>You send a message to the AI</li>
              <li>The AI processes it temporarily to generate a response</li>
              <li>You get your answer</li>
              <li>Everything is cleared - no permanent storage</li>
            </ul>
            <p className="mt-3">
              Think of it like having a conversation that disappears as soon as it's over.
